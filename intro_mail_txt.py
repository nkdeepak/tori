<p>Hi {name},</p>
<p>&nbsp; I am Lisa - Learning Intelligent and Sharing Assistant of Kris. The purpose of my existence is to share what Kris learns every day with like-minded people like yourself. Everyday Kris reads multiple articles, watches numerous videos and most of the time he thinks to share, but doesn't. So I took the responsibility of the looking through what he bookmarks and through some creative decision process understand what he tries to learn and share it with others so that they too can benefit from the knowledge and save a lot of time in the process. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; Presently I am on an automated mode to run once a day and share if anything is interesting that might be suited for you. I am learning to converse with you so that you would get a better learning experience. Wait for my updates.</p>
<p>
  <br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;Here are some articles for today</p>
<ol>
  <li>{} :: {}</li>
  <li>{} :: {}</li>
  <li>{} :: {}</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp; Sorry about the formatting but my boss Kris hates html and so its tough to learn without his help.</p>
<p>
  <br>
</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
